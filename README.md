# Welcome to the ReadMe for the Hello Project

This ReadMe was authored in Markdown, specifically GitHub Flavored Markdown, which includes syntax highlighting, task lists, tables, and @mentions. 

Emoji are also supported in Markdown! :thumbsup:
See the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http:http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com) for the complete list.

You can learn more about Markdown here - and you can also create a link automatically like this - https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf 

## More about Markdown

First, the simple stuff: *This is Italic* **This is Bold**

You can also create unordered lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
* Item 4

And also ordered lists (of course): 
 
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b

## Task Lists

Can be handy to keep track of things to do:

- [x] Task one is done
- [x] Task two is done
- [x] Task three is done
- [ ] This task is not yet done

## Code Blocks

Are easy; just open and close with three backticks.

```javascript
var first
    var name
    first = name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")
    while (name != "" && name != null) {
    	if (name < first)
		first = name
    	name = prompt("Enter new name, or OK to end")
    }
    document.write("

 First name alphabetically = " + first)
```
##Git Basics

So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.
